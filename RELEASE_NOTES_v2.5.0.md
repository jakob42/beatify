## 🎧 New Feature: Intro Only Mode

A brand-new game mode where players hear just a random 10-second intro snippet — no full tracks, pure recognition skill! Can you name the song from the opening notes alone?

- **Random 10s clips** from the track intro
- Works with all existing playlists
- Perfect for music nerds who pride themselves on instant recognition

No more navigating back to the lobby after a game ends. Quick Rematch lets players restart with the same settings in one tap — keeping the energy going between rounds.
